# UCLA Synthetic Data Workshop

**April 13th - 14th, 2023**

We are pleased to announce the UCLA synthetic data workshop. This two-day workshop is hosted by the [UCLA Department of Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) and co-sponsored by [IDRE](https://idre.ucla.edu/), [Science Hub for Humanity and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/), [ASA Section on Statistical Computing](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/home), [NISS](https://www.niss.org/) and [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/). The workshop is held at the [UCLA Faculty Club](https://facultyclub.ucla.edu/) from April 13-14, 2023.

### About
Synthetic data generation is a rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary area that
draws much attention from both academia and industry. For the development of algorithmic
procedures for fraud detection and spam identification, as well as for the construction of AI-driven
models in industries like manufacturing and supply chain management, synthetic data
has become a valuable resource. The advantages of synthetic data include cost savings, increased
speed, agility, increased intelligence, and cutting-edge privacy. According to the Gartner report,
synthetic data will overshadow real data in training machine/deep learning models by 2030; see
Figure below. Additionally, the [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045416/10-breakthrough-technologies-2022/#synthetic-data-for-ai) named synthetic data as one of its top 10 game-changing innovations for 2022. Synthetic data is everywhere: image, text, graph and tabular data; it has different names: simulated data (for physical scientists); missing value imputation (for statisticians), and more recently, GAN (for computer scientists) etc. Therefore, it is believed that synthetic data generation will be an indispensable part of the next-generation machine learning workflow.

Despite numerous successful applications of synthetic data, its scientific foundation, e.g., the
tradeoff among fidelity, utility, and privacy, is still missing. Additionally, industrial standards
for generating and utilizing synthetic data are not fully developed. Furthermore, the privacy law on synthetic data is still in its infancy. 
Therefore, this workshop is to form a community of synthetic data researchers (from statistics, machine learning and mathematics), policymakers, and industrial partners, and bring them together to collaborate on the development of the theory, methodology, and algorithms needed to produce synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms.

Therefore, one goal of this workshop is to form a community of synthetic data researchers,
policymakers, and industrial partners. This workshop brings together research communities in statistics, computer science, mathematics and law as well as industry leaders to collaborate on the development of the theory, methodology, and algorithms needed to produce synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms.

<!--
Another purpose is to facilitate data-centric Machine
Learning research by bringing together investigators in generative models and trustworthy AI
(privacy, fairness, and robustness) to collaborate on the development of the theory, methodology, 
and algorithms needed to produce synthetic benchmark datasets and algorithms. This workshop is highly 
interdisciplinary and brings together research communities in statistics, computer science, mathematics 
and law as well as industry leaders.

This includes persons from underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, and persons with disabilities). You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of underrepresented minority students, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students. 

Travel awards will cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging.
